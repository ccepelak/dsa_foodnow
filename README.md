Data Structures &amp; Algorithms Project: a Food Recommender System for Berlin

Berlin’s restaurant offering is considerable and finding a good restaurant to your liking can be a challenge. At initial glance, Google’s ratings are handy when it comes to judging a restaurant, but as with all rankings, they can easily be biased. Our program will find tailored recommendations for each user based on their preferences (food type, walking time, etc.), the ratings and their location in Berlin.
