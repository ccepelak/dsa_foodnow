# Data Structures &amp; Algorithms Final Project: a Food Recommender System for Hertie Students

Berlin’s restaurant offering is considerable and finding a good restaurant to your liking can be a challenge. At initial glance, Google’s ratings are handy when it comes to judging a restaurant, but as with all rankings, they can easily be biased. Our program will find tailored recommendations for each user based on their preferences (food type and price range) and ratings. 

We've focused our application on improved specificity in: 
<b>
  
1.) cuisine style and 
  
2.) price point. </b>
